Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
----------------------------------------

This project consists on generating a single merged tidy data provided by
UCI called Human activity recognition using smartphones data set. This dataset
was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily
living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial
sensors.

This project includes:
- *tidy.txt* which is the tidy data exported from the process refered on this project
- *CodeBook.md* describes the steps included in the main R script
- *run_analysis.R* executes the steps for transforming from collected raw data into tidy data

Original data set can be collected from:
